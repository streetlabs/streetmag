     <p>
       STREETMAG is the simplest way to create, host and manage an online publication.
     </p>
     <p>
       We are currently hosting a private beta to get our first couple of journals and magazines online. Once
       everything looks clear we will start opening up registrations.
     </p>
     <p>
       We expect to make an announcement about the release of our first journal this week!

     <h3>ABOUT STREETLABS</h3>
     <p>
       A couple of years ago being OPEN Source was good enough. We were able to share our work with colleagues and leverage the
       work of the community to bring projects like 
       <a href="http://streetprint.org"><span class="street">s<span class="street">treet</span></span><span class="labs">print</span></a>
       to them.
     </p>
     <p>
       But how OPEN is that? Haven't we learned from Twitter and Facebook that OPEN <i>really</i> means that anyone can get involved. 
       Anyone, without any technical knowledge, should be able to contribute.
     </p>
     <p>
       That is why we started 
       <a href="http://streetlabs.org"><span class="street">s<span class="street">treet</span></span><span class="labs">labs</span></a>. 
       We are creating powerful hosted, platforms that allow us all to focus on our real goals and not Computing Science.

    <h2>HOSTED • OPEN • SIMPLE</h2>
    <p>
      Our goal is to provide a hosted, open platform: a suite of tools that simplifies the work needed to share research, 
      create online publications or host a conference. <br /><br/ >
      Open source. Open to anyone.
